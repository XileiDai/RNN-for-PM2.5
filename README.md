# RNN-for-PM2.5

The RNN model to predict indoor PM2.5 concentration. The data templates are shown in file Test-sep.csv, Test.csv, Train-sep.csv, Train.csv.

## Code structure
+ `Train_and_test.py`: main file to train and test the model.
+ `get_seq.py`: main file to get the time-series of test dataset. 
+ `vis.py`: main file to get the prediction results using trained model.
+ `multi_step.py`: main file to get the prediction result for multiple prediciton length using trained model.
